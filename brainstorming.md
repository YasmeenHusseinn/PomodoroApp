- **Scope:** The app should be able to be completed before the course ends

2. Clothes matcher

- **Mobile:** Mobile is needed to easily and quickly pick an outfit 
- **Story:** Allows people to take pictures of the clothes in their closet. Now people can see all the pieces of clothing they have easily.
- **Market:** Anyone interested in fashion, is organized, or just wants to quickly pick an outfit will like this app
- **Habit:** People will use it when they need to dress up which is every day
- **Scope:** The app should be able to be completed before the course ends
